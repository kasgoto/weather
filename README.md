Weather forecast app built on React

App asks for user's location permission, and if granted - immediately parses weather info and 3-day forecast for current location. If not, user can type in any city and the searchbox will autofill its name. App is adaptive and looks well on all devices.

API's used:

- Mapbox (implementing search city autofill for better user experience)
- Openweather API (current weather, forecast and weather images)

Technologies used: react/tailwind/axios
